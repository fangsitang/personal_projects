# Personal Investing 🚀

I'm a big fan of investing and trading. I began my journey in 2018, but things really kicked off in 2023. Here's a snapshot of my positions so far, as of December 2024 👇

| Asset   | Book Value     | Market Value  | YTD P&L  |  
| :---:  |  :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| PLTR   | 5,515.03     | 14,754.71    | 267%  |
| TESLA    | 978.26       | 1,450.70     | 48% |
| BAC    | 105.62    | 148.97    | 42% |
| C    | 132.73      | 199.89    | 51% |
| ETH    | 1,935.50      | 3,744.13    | 93% |
| BTC    | 605.90     | 2,280.21    | 373% |

To determine my positions, I use fundamental analysis and machine learning methods! Sometimes, a little bit of statistics / mathematics.
